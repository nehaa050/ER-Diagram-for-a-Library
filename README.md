# AIM:                                                                                                                                                        
In this project, we are going to manage our public library. This involves books, authors, users, publishers, suppliers, genres, borrowing, fines, and reservations. Our goal is to assist staff, library members, and other stakeholders. Database is systematized way of storing and retrieving valuable data. Our main goal from this assignment is to provide a solution for managing library operations. By doing this, we will be able to enhance the user efficiency and provide impeccable insights and patterns. 

# OBJECTIVES: 
 - Managing Data Effectively : To make sure that there is efficient storage of data which consists of books, users, authors, genres, publishers, suppliers, borrowing records, fines and reservations.                                                                                                                                  
 - Access and Managing of User : User access and management is required to efficiently manage tasks for library members like user registration and other tasks.                                                                                                                                                                      
 - Inventory Administration : To keep track of libraryâ€™s book stock which consists of book, genre, authors and availability of books.

 - Transaction Monitoring : To keep a track of borrowing and returning of books by members.                                                                                                                             
 - Reservation System : Reservation system helps to check the status whether books are available or not and accordingly assign the book to the member.

 - Reporting: Reporting leads to accurate reports, so that insights on books circulation, user activity and library inventory can be generated.
 
 - Security and entry restriction: Security and Access Control is required so that there is proper data security and data integrity maintained. (Morris, 2016)

# CONCLUSION:
 - The library database aims to efficiently manage all aspects of library operations, from user registration to book management and reporting.
 - By addressing the needs of stakeholders like library staff, members, and external entities, the database ensures smooth functioning, better user experience, and valuable insights through reporting and analytics. 
 - Key objectives include efficient data management, user access facilitation, inventory tracking, transaction monitoring, reservation handling, and robust security measures.
